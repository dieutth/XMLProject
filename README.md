# XMLProject
A simple RESTful web service (server side).

Motivation:
- Searching "Lttl Women" in Goodread return no result.
- Searching "Lttl Women book" in Google, get result "Little Women"

The idea is to store a list of book titles, use Lucene to correct typo in query string before calling Goodread API to take review from it.
